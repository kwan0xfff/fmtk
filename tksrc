# tksrc - Link to toolkit source.

This file should not exist in the source tree.

This toolkit is being redesigned to support builds of multiple targets
from a common source tree (i.e., the one in which this file is found).
However, the multi-target quickstart tools are not yet working.

To allow work in this tree until the tools are working, perform a
symlink from 'tksrc' to this directory.  That is,
    $ ln -s . tksrc
